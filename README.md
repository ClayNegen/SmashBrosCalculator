In Super Smash Brothers, each ability (or move) is active for a certain number of frames. During this time you cannot input anything new. 
This Frame Data is important to high level players, and accessible online. 
My application takes those numbers, and the knowledge that the game is set to run at 60fps, to give you a Calculation for how much time a move takes for every character and every move in the game.
